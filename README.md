# Build-Videorecorder-Bundle-use-Networkoptix-Client-on-HYY-RK3566-Tablet
This repository is the documentation for RK3566 rk3568 tablet products, written by R&D Team of HYY Technology Co.,Ltd.

I need the Linux Firmware for the RK3588 too. We have found out that 4K/8K videos are buggy in Linux. But we want to do a small video server with networkoptix video software. Can you do us the Linux Image for this, that we can test.
networkoptix.com

Can you tell me the config steps for networkoptix. And how test for you.
I can do new Linux img for you.


Which one is the application we need.
